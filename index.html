            <h3>Create new stories and new hobbies </h3>
            <p> Normally, I like to hear and tell jokes and stories to my friends. I help my younger cousins in doing
                their home works daily. I love my parents very much. They also love me and promote me to do well in
                every field. They motivate and inspire me to study. My family is a cultural family. When we celebrate
                each festival together, we enjoyed it and have a great time. Really, I am fortunate to have this family.

            <p> Awake, I opened my eyes to see
                A hospital, so white and clean
                I was walking up to the roof, I think
                Then can't recall at all a single thing
                Held a hand for me, you were there
                I know, but couldn't reach
                The me that would fall down all the time
                But stand and reach my hand to see
                "Have you tried crossing over yet?" </p>

                And the scars never fade
                Memories that replay
                Rewind yet again to the pain we felt on that day </p>
